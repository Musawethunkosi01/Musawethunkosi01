        <p id="P1"> I am a Computer Information Systems graduate from the University of the Free State and I consider myself well-prepared to tackle the dynamic challenges of the tech industry.
             With a solid foundation in both technical and business aspects, I have gained skills in object-oriented programming, systems analysis, and data management, while also understanding the strategic role of technology in organizational success. 
             The University of the Free State's comprehensive curriculum has equipped me with the ability to design, implement, and manage innovative information systems, making them valuable assets to businesses seeking to optimize their operations and drive digital transformation.
             I am always eager to expand my skill set and embrace new challenges, as I believe that continuous learning is key to success in this rapidly changing industry. I am now actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge in a professional setting, where I can contribute to the development of innovative solutions and make a positive impact</p>
